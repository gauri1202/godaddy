# GoDaddy GitHub Repositories App

## 🧪 Overview
A simple React app to display repositories from GoDaddy’s GitHub organization using GitHub's REST API.

## 🚀 Setup
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- React Router DOM (routing)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- React Testing Library + Jest (testing)

## 📝 Notes
- Focused on simplicity and user clarity.
- Used functional components and hooks.
- Languages used per repo require another API call (`/languages`), which was skipped to avoid over-complication.

## 📦 Improvements Possible
- Add pagination
- Fetch full list of languages per repo
- Better error handling UI
